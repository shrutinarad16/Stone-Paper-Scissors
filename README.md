# 🪨📄✂️ Stone Paper Scissors Game

A simple **Stone–Paper–Scissors** game built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** during my initial days of learning front-end development.  
This project demonstrates my understanding of **basic programming logic**, **DOM manipulation**, and **interactive UI design**.

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a browser-based version of the classic **Stone–Paper–Scissors** game where a user plays against the computer.  
The computer randomly selects its move, and the winner is decided based on standard game rules.

This project was created to practice core JavaScript concepts and to understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together.
